# CHANGELOG

`@mscbot` is Rust's automated process manager for RFCs, tracking issues, etc.
As such, this application does not follow semver of any form.

However, we do maintain this changelog explaining high level changes to the way
mscbot behaves so that the people who develop mscbot or interact with it can
understand the bot better.

## Changes

+ mscbot now accepts multiple invocations / commands per comment you post.
